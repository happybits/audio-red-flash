# audio-red-flash

This project is a sample to show the spurious red status bar flash that occurs when stopping an audio recording.

Repro steps:
1) Press Start to start audio recordering
2) Press Stop to stop audio recording

Observe that the status bar flashes red when audio recording is stopped.

Note that this only occurs if the Background Audio mode is enabled in the project.
